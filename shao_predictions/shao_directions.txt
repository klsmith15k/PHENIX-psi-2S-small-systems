There are a few tips worth mentioning:

0. We used the 200 GeV  PHENIX pp data (1105.1966) to fit psi(2S) and jpsi.

1. We only provided reweighted (tagged as 'Rwgt') nCTEQ15 and EPPS16 results (proton PDF we used CT14NLO) from  our 1712.07024 (the jpsi constraint) and the LHAPDF grids available from 2012.11462.

2. I also present 68CL and 90CL results. In default, the nPDFs give 90CL for some historical reasons. In 1712.07024, we converted to 68CL (i.e. 1 sigma). You can choose what you want with a proper indication/specification in your paper.

3. I also include the different sets due to the different factorization scales. In 1712.07024  it is the dominant uncertainty in the reweighed results from jpsi. With the reweighted nPDFs, there are 3 factorization scales (MUFc, MUFd, MUFu) for jpsi. We strongly suggest to consider the scale dependencies. In your case, you can take the envelope of 3 scales in the these files.

4. I calculate both the minimum-biased (i.e. 0-100% centrality class) RpAu (tagged as 'MB') and RpAu in your centrality classes (0-20%, 'Cen0To20'), (20-40%, 'Cen20To40'), (40-85%,'Cen40To85'), and (20-85%,'Cen20To85'). This is doable thanks to the centrality class and b slicing correspondence table sent by David (in cc), based on his Monte Carlo Glauber (MCG) code in 1710.07098. The centrality-dependent observables require additional modeling/assumptions of the b-dependent gluon shadowing. I used Eq.(15) in 2001.04256 and Optical Glauber (OG) model to model it. There are ambiguities in the form of function G(x) in the equation. The widespread form is G(x)~x^a with a=1. It however has never been rigorously tested. My recent study (cf. Figure 55 in 2012.14161) reveals the LHCb same-sign D data in pPb prefer larger values of a. I therefore provide both a=1 (tagged as 'a1') and a=2 (tagged as 'a2') for the non minimum biased predictions. You can compare and state it clearly in the text. Note that because the b slicing I have is 5% per interval, I can only provide you 85% instead of 84%, which I believe should be very close in any case.

5. For the mean binary collisions in the centrality classes you listed, I have two sets of numbers. The first one is from MCG by David (1710.07098), and the second one is from my OG calculation with b slicing provided by David. They are as follows.

centrality           <Ncoll> MCG                <Ncoll> OG
0-20%               8.21+-2.75                     8.32
20-40%             6.58+-2.42                     6.77
40-85%             3.49+-1.59                     3.10
20-85%             4.20+-1.78                     4.15

6. There are both RpAu vs PT (tagged as '_PT_') and RpAu vs yCMS (tagged as '_yCMS_'), which you can read directly from the file names. For RpAu vs PT, there are both the forward ('fwd', 1.2<yCMS<2.2) and the backward ('bad',-2.2<yCMS<-1.2) files.

7. Of course, we only include the (impact-parameter-dependent) shadowing effect here. For psi(2S), it is known that one should include the final state effect (e.g. comover), which is absent in our prediction.

The description of tables are as follows.


----------------------
description of tables
----------------------

After you untar it, you can find several text files. Each one represents RpAu within your fiducial volume. Let us take psi2S_yCMS_PHENIX_nCTEQ15.90CL.MUFc.Rwgt.Cen0To20.a1.dat as an example. It is a table corresponding to the reweighted nCTEQ15 result (with the central scale MUFc) of yCMS distribution for psi(2S) at 90CL error and within the centrality class 0-20% and taking a=1 in b-dependent modeling. I also enclosed the reweighted nCTEQ15 (named 'nCTEQ15') / EPPS16 (named 'EPPS16') results at both 68CL (named '68CL') and 90CL (named '90CL') errors with our three scale choices (MU_F=0.5*MU_{0} (named 'MUFd'), MU_F=2.0*MU_{0} (named 'MUFu') and MU_F=MU_{0} (named 'MUFc')).

Let me explain the format of each table. There are 5 numbers in each row of each table, which you can find in the following form

xmin  xmax   RpAu (cen)    RpAu (min)   RpAu (max)

where xmin and xmax are the lower and upper value of the bin in yCMS, RpAu (cen/min/max) is (central/minimal/maximal) p+Au RpAu in that bin. For example, in  psi2S_yCMS_PHENIX_nCTEQ15.90CL.MUFc.Rwgt.Cen0To20.a1.dat, the first row is

-2.2000000e+00 -1.2000000e+00 +1.1860062e+00 +1.0710318e+00 +1.3009806e+00

which means in -2.2<yCMS<-1.2, the central value of RpAu = +1.1860062e+00 in this bin.

If you are using the numbers I sent, I would be appreciated if you can refer to both \cite{Lansberg:2016deg,Kusina:2017gkz,Kusina:2020dki} (the first one is our original method proposed and the last two are our recent reweighed studies) and the HELAC-Onia papers \cite{Shao:2012iz,Shao:2015vga} (the tool to calculate them), and others that are relevant for you which I mentioned above (e.g. 1710.07098).
